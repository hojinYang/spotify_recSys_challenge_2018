## Intoduction
This repository contains the tensorflow v1 implementation of our entry for main track. 
We propose MMCF, which is consists of two components: (1) Context-aware autoencoders using 
both the playlist and its categorical contents and (2) Character-level convolutional neural networks 
that learn the latent relationship between playlists and their titles.

## Dataset
Spotify has produced the MPD(Million Playlist Dataset) which contains a million user-curated playlists. 
Each playlist in the MPD contains a playlist title, a list of tracks(with metadata), and other miscellaneous information. 

## Preprocess The Data
Proceed with these steps to convert the MPD’s data format into our system's.
1. Download Spotify's MPD tar file which contains a thousand MPD-slice json files(each contains a thounsand playlists).
2. Divide json files into two groups: training folder and test folder. And place each data folders into the root folder of the project.
3. You can get resturctured data by running **data_generator.py**.  
*Arguments of data_generator.py*   
`--datadir`		: Directory where converted dataset(training, test, challenge) will be stored. *default: ./data*  
`--mpd_tr`		: Directory which contains MPD-slice json files used for training the model. *default: ./mpd_train*  
`--mpd_te`		: Directory which contains MPD-slice json files used for testing the model. *default: ./mpd_test*     
`--mpd_ch`		: Directory which contains the challenge set json file. *default: ./challenge*   
`--mincount_trk`	: The minimum number of occurences of tracks in the train data *default: 5*  
`--mincount_art`	: The minimum number of occurences of artists in the train data *default: 3*  
`--divide_ch`		: A list where each elements is a range of challenge seed numbers *default: 0-1,5,10-25,10-25r* 	    
For example, you can set the dicrectories as the following command : 
```console  
python data_generator.py --datadir ./data --mpd_tr ./mpd_train --mpd_te ./mpd_test --mpd_ch ./challenge
```
You can set the minimum number of occurences of tracks and artists on training set manually. 
When you run the following command, tracks with less than three occurrences are removed:
```console
python data_generator.py --mincount_trk 3 
```
4. Scripts above populate the ‘./data’ with one training json file, multiple types of test json, and challenge json.  

    
Each test files contains same seed pattern as Spotify RecSys Challenge: seed 0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 100, 25r, 100r.  
We also divide challenge set into four categories based on seed pattern by default: (0,1) , (5) , (10,25,100) , (25r,100r)  
 
For submission, we train our models with four different denoising schemes.
Each schemes performs better on one of four different challenge categories.  


## Implementation Detail
Our model is composed of two parts: Denoising Autoencoders and Character-level CNN; 
train the parameters of the DAE first, then integrate with char-level CNN.
1. Create a folder into the root folder of the project. *config.ini* file, which contains information required to run the model, 
must be placed into the created folder(Check the structure of *conf.ini* below).  
2. You can train models by running **main.py**.  
*Arguments of main.py*   
`--dir`			: Directory name which contains config file.  
`--pretrain`	: Pretrain dae parameters if specified.  
`--dae`			: Train dae parameters if specified.  
`--title`		: Train paramters of title module if specified.  
`--challenge`	: Generate challenge submission candidates if specified.  
`--testmode`	: Get the results without training the model if specified.   
Suppose the folder you create at the step above is './sample'.   
we recommand you to **pretrain the DAE with tied condition**; constrain decoder’s weights to be equal to transposed encoder’s.
Using those weights as initial values of DAE brings much better results than not pretraining the weights.   
First, run main in pretrain mode(tied DAE):  
```console
python main.py --dir sample --pretrain
```
Run main in DAE mode after the loss is converged in pretrain mode.
If you set pretrain file name in config.ini file, following command will use pretrained paramters saved in the fold you created(./sample). 
You can also train DAE without initital value depending on the *config.ini* setting:  
```console
python main.py --dir sample --dae
```
After you run DAE, its parameters are saved as pickle format in ./sample.   

3. You can train char-CNN if DAE’s parameters is save in the folder you created. After you run the command below, the final tensor graph will be generated:
```console
python main.py --dir sample --title
```
4. Finally you can generate challenge submission candidates by using graph and DAE paramters you get at the steps above:  
```console
python main.py --dir sample --challenge
```
**[note]**  
For all models, paramters are updated if the avearge of *update_seeds* r-precision score(s) increases. Our system calculates r-precision score every epoch.  
You must specify only one mode(dae, title, challenge) when you set arguments of *main.py*.  
You can easily replace parameter pickle files(for DAE) and/or ckpt graph file(for title) with other directories, 
if both have same number of tracks & artists and same CNN filter shapes.     
If you want to just check metrices scores after replacing paramters with directory's, using *--testmode* is efficient:
```console
# after replacing DAE pickle file from another folder #
python main.py --dir sample --dae --testmode
```

## Submission Configuration
We already set the initial setting: create 4 different directories(0to1_inorder,5_inorder,10to100_inorder, 25to100_random), 
and set config files of each directories.  
1. Divide 1,000 *mpd.slice.#.json files* into two directories(mpd_train, mpd_test). We use 997 slices for training 
except *'mpd.slice.250000-250999', 'mpd.slice.500000-500999', 'mpd.slice.750000-750999'* which are used for testing the model.  
The directory containing *challenge_set.json* is also needed for generating challenge data following our format.  
2. Run **data_generator.py** with default arguments(or change if you want). 
Then './data' is created which contains training data and test data with multiple categories as json format. 
Challenge data with four different categories are also created as we set `--divide_ch` of **data_generator.py** as *0-1,5,10-25,10-25r(andom)*.  
Dividing challenge data into four categories means we use four different denoising schemes to train our model 
and merge the results at the last moment.  
3. We already set four different directories which contain *config.ini* optimized for each challenge categories. 
The approximante information is shown in the table below.  
4. Run in pretrain mode for each directories. Then run in dae mode except 0to1_inorder.  
5. For title mode, it is more efficient to run in just one directory(0to1_inorder) 
and copy the tensor graph outputs(generated after running on title mode) to others. 
You don't have to train in title mode for all directories, as outputs are same.  
6. Run challenge mode for each directories.  
7. Run **merge_results.py** to merge results from different directories and to generate results.csv files.  

| directory | challenge category | firstN_range | input denoising | pretrain only	|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0to1_inorder | challenge_inorder_0to1 | 0, 0.3 | 0.75 | True |
| 5_inorder | challenge_inorder_5 | 1, 50 | 0.75 | False |
| 10to100_inorder | challenge_inorder_10to100 | 0.3, 0.6 | 0.75 | False |
| 25to100_random | challenge_random_25to100 | -1 | 0.5, 0.8 | False |  

In summary, run the following commands one line at a time:  
```console
# 997 mpd.slice on ./mpd_train, 3 mpd.slice on ./mpd_test, challenge set on ./challenge #  
python data_generator.py  
python main.py --dir 0to1_inorder --pretrain  
python main.py --dir 0to1_inorder --title  
python main.py --dir 0to1_inorder --challenge  
# copy 0to1_inorder/graph to 5_inorder #
python main.py --dir 5_inorder --pretrain  
python main.py --dir 5_inorder --dae  
python main.py --dir 5_inorder --challenge  
# copy 0to1_inorder/graph to 10to100_inorder #
python main.py --dir 10to100_inorder --pretrain  
python main.py --dir 10to100_inorder --dae  
python main.py --dir 10to100_inorder --challenge  
# copy 0to1_inorder/graph to 25to100_inorder #
python main.py --dir 25to100_random --pretrain  
python main.py --dir 25to100_random --dae  
python main.py --dir 25to100_random --challenge  

python merge_results.py
```
**[Note]**  
* It takes about 3\~4 days to train using the whole MPD under our environment.  
* We set every epochs as 20. If the r-precision of *update_seed* continuously decreases and no parameters update occur, 
it is recommended to stop the operation manually and proceed to the next steps. 
Also, more epochs might be needed if you train using small data set.  
* You should modify some lines of code in *models/DAEs.py* if your system has fewer than three GPUs.
